| API family name | IP high-throughput elastic network API |
| API family owner | China Mobile |
| API summary | This API provides scheduling ability of huge data transmission in network. It can calculate load-balancing paths automatically with given time duration, total data amount and bandwidth limit, and satisfy huge data transmission requirements with dynamic and elastic bandwidth allocation algorithms, tidal-traffic-aware segment list adjustment and SRv6 multiple segment list technology.<br /><br />IP high-throughput elastic network API has been successfully commercialized across a variety of sectors. This API enable network operators to monetize their dynamic bandwidth requirements effectively. The capabilities of high throughput and extensive bandwidth present considerable potential for future market applications. It is particularly important in advanced fields such as technological research, astronomical and meteorological analysis, data backup, and video editing, where significant advances have led to the emergence of a large number of commercial use cases.<br/>This API is suitable for customers in industries with massive data transfer requirements, such as Cross-cloud backup, model training at intelligent compute centers, video editing, and scientific computing. For example, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), located in GuiZhou province of China, could generate more than 10 PB of observational data per year. By calling this API, users can dynamically adjust bandwidth and elastically orchestrate network resources according to their specific requirements for bandwidth, latency, and file size. This capability facilitates the efficient and expedient transmission of large observational datasets within short timeframes. <br /><br />Input:<br/>1.
