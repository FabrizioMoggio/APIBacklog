| API family name | IP high-throughput elastic network API |
| API family owner | China Mobile |
| API summary | This API provides scheduling ability of huge data transmission in network. It can calculate load-balancing paths automatically with given time duration, total data amount and bandwidth limit, and satisfy huge data transmission requirements with dynamic and elastic bandwidth allocation algorithms, tidal-traffic-aware segment list adjustment and SRv6 multiple segment list technology.<br /><br />IP high-throughput elastic network API has been successfully commercialized across a variety of sectors. This API enable network operators to monetize their dynamic bandwidth requirements effectively. The capabilities of high throughput and extensive bandwidth present considerable potential for future market applications. It is particularly important in advanced fields such as technological research, astronomical and meteorological analysis, data backup, and video editing, where significant advances have led to the emergence of a large number of commercial use cases.<br/>This API is suitable for customers in industries with massive data transfer requirements, such as Cross-cloud backup, model training at intelligent compute centers, video editing, and scientific computing. For example, the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), located in GuiZhou province of China, could generate more than 10 PB of observational data per year. By calling this API, users can dynamically adjust bandwidth and elastically orchestrate network resources according to their specific requirements for bandwidth, latency, and file size. This capability facilitates the efficient and expedient transmission of large observational datasets within short timeframes. <br /><br />Input:<br/>1. Bandwidth Requirement: Time-segmented bandwidth requirements (can include multiple time points)<br/>2. Bandwidth Requirement Type: Upload bandwidth, download bandwidth, two-way bandwidth Service<br/>3. Latency Requirement: Latency guarantee requirement range<br/>4. File Requirements: Size of files to be transmitted <br/>5. Guarantee Requirements: Bandwidth guarantee and load sharing requirements<br/><br />Output:<br/>1. Success or failure<br/>2. Estimation of transmission rate by time segment<br/>3. Estimated transmission duration,<br/>4. Statistical conclusions after successful transmission1. Estimation of transmission rate by time segment<br/>5. (optional) any conditions required for the operator to meet the request (e.g. a particular entry point to the network must be used). |
| Uniqueness | From the specifications of the three APIs NetworkSlicing, QoD, and DedicatedNetwork, we can see that the technologies they are based on are all wireless professional slicing and SLA guarantee technologies. The technology used by this API is the UCMP or ECMP capabilities implemented by the srv6 technology, which belongs to the technology in the field of IP bearer network. Therefore, this API is essentially very different from the above three APIs. |
| Technical viability | This API leverages the IETF RFC8402 Segment Routing Architecture and RFC8986 SR Multi-SEGment Multi-Complexity Balancing technology based on SR Network Programming Segment Routing over IPv6 (SR) Network Programming and RFC6241 Network Configuration Protocol Protocol (NETCONF) adjusts QoS technology in real time to achieve the availability of high-throughput, high-bandwidth APIs. |
| Commercial viability | IP high-throughput elastic web application APIs have been commercialized in many fields. Help operators monetize their variable bandwidth needs. High-throughput and high-bandwidth capabilities have great potential for market applications in the future, and are particularly important in scientific and technological research, astronomical meteorology, data backup, film and television editing and other scenarios, scientific research and other fields, and many commercial scenarios have emerged. |
